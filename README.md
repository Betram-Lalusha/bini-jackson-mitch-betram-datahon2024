# Overview
Our group's focus was on small businesses owned by women. Our aim is to figure out which factors result in higher contract awards to small-women owned businesses and which factors play a trivial role in this outcome. We sought to solve this problem by gaining insights from data visualization and regression analysis.
The inclusion initiative for EPA procurement focuses on key stakeholders such as government regulatory bodies, women-owned small businesses, private sector firms, affected communities, and environmental advocacy groups to facilitate the procurement of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contract awards for small businesses owned by women. To analyze and support this initiative, a comprehensive approach involving data cleaning and preparation, time series, regression analysis, and the calculation of the R-squared value was employed. This methodical analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and potential hurdles in the procurement process, with the ultimate goal of enhancing participation and success rates for women-owned small businesses in securing EPA contracts.
